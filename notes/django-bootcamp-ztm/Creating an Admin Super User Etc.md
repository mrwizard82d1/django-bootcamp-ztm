We begin our look at the Django admin interface

One begins using the admin interface by logging in
- Navigate to 'admin/'
- We are prompted to log in with administrative credentials
	- However, we have not yet created any admin accounts!

Create (the) admin account (super user)
- Execute `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Supply admin username, email, and password
	- Be sure to remember the details for subsequent authentication
