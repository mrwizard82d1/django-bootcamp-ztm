An example: ordering food at a restaurant
- Views are 
	- The What
	- Ordering the pizza
- URLs are
	- The "Where"
	- Requesting the pizza (when cooked)

URLs and Views work **in pairs**
- Restaurant
	- URL like going to the counter and ordering your pizza
	- View like chef making the pizza
- In Django,
	- URLs (where): navigating to "site.com/about"
	- View (what): Returns the "About page"

Want a specific request for pizza
- Pepperoni
- Django: "Dynamic URLs"
	- Allow passing of details to "configure" pages
